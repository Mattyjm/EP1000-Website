						<h2> Laser Cutting </h2>
						
						<p> This assignment looks at laser cutters, the laser cutting process, how to operate a laser cutter and design products for and fabricate them using laser cutters. </p>
						
						<h3> Laser Cutting Certification </h3>
							<p> 
								To be able to use the laser cutters in the FabLab, we are required to pass a online quiz, as well as a on-site practical. 
							<br> We were tasked to laser cut a nametag, to show that we are able to use the machine.

						<h3> Problems that occured: </h3>
						
						<p> When adjusting the settings on CorelDraw, I accidently set the width of the nametag as 35mm, instead of the height. 
						<br> (In this case, the width is the length of the nametag) 
						<br> This made the nametag too small, and caused problems when cutting.
						
						<br> <br> Due to the models' small size, the lines were too close together. Therefore the laser cutters' beam is not thin enough to cut each line perfectly, and overcuts each line.
						
						<br> <br> Another problem that occured (due to the small size of the nametag), was that it ended up tipping. 
						<br> In turn, the logo was not cut properly; the laser cutter was stil cutting even after the nametag was tipping.
						<br>Not only that, the insides of the logo fell out as the thin supports could not hold the weight.

						<h3> Assignment: Laser Cut Parametric Box </h3>
						
						<p> In this assignment, we were tasked to make a accessory box no larger than A5 (21cm * 14.8cm). 
						The specifications are as shown in the screenshots below. </p>
						
						
						<table align="center" width="800">

						<p>I decided to create a 2 layer box that would have a bottom drawer. This bottom drawer will feature a modular with removable dividers. </p>

						<h3> Problems that occured: </h3>
						
						<p>  
							Some of the problems that i faced was due to the fact that i did not account for the laser cutter's kerf. 
							Laser kerf occurs when the laser burns away a portion of material when it cuts through. 
							This results in the material that is cut to be slightly smaller than expected.
						</p>	
							
						<p align="center"> <img src="images/Laser Cutting/laserkerf.png" width="380" height=""> </p>
							
						<p>	
							To counter this, the cutting line should be offset by the kerf value. This kerf value can be found by cutting a test piece, 
							and measuring the difference between the actual cut piece, and the hole in the material, divided by 2. Average kerf values range from 0.08 to 1mm.
						</p>
						
						<p> 
							Another problem that I faced when laser cutting my pieces, was that the laser cutter was not able to cut the plywood through the first time. 
							I was careless, and did not check for double lines in my .dxf files. During cutting, the laser cutter cut the double lines twice,
							which made the cutting process longer and not as efficient.
							
							Both of these factors made the wood warp, due to the constant heat it was under. This in turn made the fitting process take longer than expected, 
							as the plywood had to be flattened and bent into shape before being able to fit in.
