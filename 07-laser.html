						<h2> Laser Cutting </h2>
						
						<p> This assignment looks at laser cutters, the laser cutting process, how to operate a laser cutter and design products for and fabricate them using laser cutters.
							<br> add nametag + laptop stand fusion files in here
							<br> assignment: accessories box
						</p>
						
						<h3> Laser Cutting Certification </h3>
							<p> 
								To be able to use the laser cutters in the FabLab, we are required to pass a online quiz, as well as a on-site practical. 
							<br> We were tasked to laser cut a nametag, to show that we are able to use the machine.

						<h3> Problems that occured </h3>
						
						<p> When adjusting the settings on CorelDraw, I accidently set the width of the nametag as 35mm, instead of the height. 
						<br> (In this case, the width is the length of the nametag) 
						<br> This made the nametag too small, and caused problems when cutting.
						
						<br> <br> Due to the models' small size, the lines were too close together. Therefore the laser cutters' beam is not thin enough to cut each line perfectly, and overcuts each line.
						
						<br> <br> Another problem that occured (due to the small size of the nametag), was that it ended up tipping. 
						<br> In turn, the logo was not cut properly; the laser cutter was stil cutting even after the nametag was tipping.
						<br>Not only that, the insides of the logo fell out as the thin supports could not hold the weight.
