					<h2 align="center"> What is Arduino? </h2>
					
					<p>
						<a href="https://www.arduino.cc/" style="color:#0000FF"> Arduino </a> is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. 
						Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. 
						You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board. 
						
						To do so you use the Arduino programming language (based on Wiring), and the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/software" style="color:#0000FF"> Arduino Software (IDE) </a>, 
						based on <a href="https://processing.org/" style="color:#0000FF"> Processing</a>.
						
						<br><br> Thanks to its simple and accessible user experience, Arduino has been used in thousands of different projects and applications. The Arduino software is easy-to-use for beginners.
						Arduino is a key tool to learn new things. Anyone - children, hobbyists, artists, programmers - can start tinkering just following the step by step instructions of a kit, or sharing ideas online with other members of the Arduino community.

					<h3 align="center"> Benefits of using Arduino: </h3>
					
					<dl>
						<dt> Inexpenive: </dt>
							<dd> - Arduino boards are relatively inexpensive compared to other microcontroller platforms. 
							The least expensive version of the Arduino module can be assembled by hand, and even the pre-assembled Arduino modules cost less than $50</dd>
							
						<dt>  <br> Simple, clear programming environment: <dt>
							<dd>- The Arduino Software (IDE) is easy-to-use for beginners, yet flexible enough for advanced users to take advantage of as well. 
								For teachers, it's conveniently based on the Processing programming environment, so students learning to program in that environment will be familiar with how the Arduino IDE works.</dd>
								
						<dt> <br> Open source and extensible software: <dt>
							<dd> - The Arduino software is published as open source tools, available for extension by experienced programmers. 
							The language can be expanded through C++ libraries, and people wanting to understand the technical details can make the leap from Arduino to the AVR C programming language on which it's based.</dd>

					The program we used to simulate the arduino code is called Tinkercad, and is a powerful software that has Arduino simulations, as well as a inbuilt code compiler. 
					This is a simple 10 second countdown timer made with the void(loop) functiion, and using the digital output pins 2 through 8.
					
					<br><br> The code is done via brute force; where there is no algorithm that is it based on, and is created via copy/pasting and editng the digitalWrite values according to the number that needs to be shown.
					This is a extremely inefficient way of creating code, and is one of the problems that can be a issue when the assigments get more complex and have more steps.

					Task: Connect a LED with a current limiting resistor (220 ohm) to port 6 of the Arduino Uno board, and write a program to blink the LED in a variety of patterns.
					<br> In this case, the pattern was just simply to blink with 200 millisecond intervals (stay on for 200ms, turn off for 200ms).
					
					
					<h4 align="center"> Controlling 3 or more LEDs:</h4>
					
					<p align="center"> <iframe width="800" height="453" src="https://www.tinkercad.com/embed/7hnU9YazOPI?editbtn=1" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe> </p>
					Task: Using the same technique, connect 3 or more LEDs of different colors to the Arduino board using pins 6, 7, and 8. Write a program to produce running lights i.e. the LEDs are lit in sequence e.g. R -> G -> W -> R -> G -> W and so on.
					<br> I built on the code from the previous part, and added cases for each possible situation for when the LEDs light up. I then created a integer value that increases by 1 every loop. 
					Its modulus of 4 (3 cases + 1 overflow) is used to determine which LED turns on.
					
					<h4 align="center"> Adding a switch: </h4>

					Task: add a switch to the circuit in (2). You should use a pull-up resistor of 10K if you are operating in INPUT mode. When the switch is pressed, the LEDs will light up. Pressing the switch again will turn the LEDs off.
					<br> Continuing to build on the previous code, I just added a button to
