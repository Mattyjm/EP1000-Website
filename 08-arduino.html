					<h2 align="center"> What is Arduino? </h2>
					
					<p> 
						Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. 
						Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. 
						You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board. 
						
						To do so you use the Arduino programming language (based on Wiring), and the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/software" style="color:#0000FF"> Arduino Software (IDE) </a>, 
						based on <a href="https://processing.org/" style="color:#0000FF"> Processing</a>.
						
						<br><br> Thanks to its simple and accessible user experience, Arduino has been used in thousands of different projects and applications. The Arduino software is easy-to-use for beginners.
						Arduino is a key tool to learn new things. Anyone - children, hobbyists, artists, programmers - can start tinkering just following the step by step instructions of a kit, or sharing ideas online with other members of the Arduino community.

					<h3 align="center"> Benefits of using Arduino: </h3>
					
					<dl>
						<dt> Inexpenive: </dt>
							<dd> - Arduino boards are relatively inexpensive compared to other microcontroller platforms. 
							The least expensive version of the Arduino module can be assembled by hand, and even the pre-assembled Arduino modules cost less than $50</dd>
							
						<dt>  <br> Simple, clear programming environment: <dt>
							<dd>- The Arduino Software (IDE) is easy-to-use for beginners, yet flexible enough for advanced users to take advantage of as well. 
								For teachers, it's conveniently based on the Processing programming environment, so students learning to program in that environment will be familiar with how the Arduino IDE works.</dd>
								
						<dt> <br> Open source and extensible software: <dt>
							<dd> - The Arduino software is published as open source tools, available for extension by experienced programmers. 
							The language can be expanded through C++ libraries, and people wanting to understand the technical details can make the leap from Arduino to the AVR C programming language on which it's based.</dd>
