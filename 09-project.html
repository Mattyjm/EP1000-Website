					<h2 align="center"> Final Project Idea: </h2>
					
					<p> My final project is a Trash-Bot, that would open and close automatically, with the help ultrasonic sensors acting as a input device and a servo motor acting as a output device. 
					The ultrasonic sensor would sense when there is a hand near the sensor, and send a signal for the servo to turn and open the box.
					My target audience is the people who want a hands-free box opening experience.
					
					<br> <br> This projects takes inspiration from the <a href="https://projecthub.arduino.cc/ashraf_minhaj/c81effad-d583-40bb-9d20-808803efbdf2" style="color:#0000FF"> Arduino Project Hub </a>.
					<br> My project is slightly different, as it uses laser cut plywood to create box, has a 3D-printed holder for the ultrasonic sensor, and improves on the overall cleanliness of the design.
				
					
					<!-- In this final project you will demonstrate the skills and techniques that you have learnt in the module. This is an individual project. The project must have the following components: -->
						<!-- Documentation - Idea, Construction, How-do, Instruction manual -->
						<!-- CADD and/or Digital graphic components (vector/raster)  -->
						<!-- 2D cutting and engraving  -->
						<!-- 3D printed part(s) -->
						<!-- Embedded control using a micro-controller with input(s) and output(s) -->
					
					
					<!-- When you select and finalize your project, please take note of:  -->
						<!-- What you intend your project to do -->
						<!-- What are its limitations -->
						<!-- Who your project is intended for (the users) -->
						<!-- Who has done your project before and why it is different. -->
					
					
					<!-- The documentation of the project, housed in github together with your module journey. The documentation must contain the following sections:  -->
						<!-- A preliminary project sketch, the project design (where it came from, who has done what before, what changes you have made) -->
						<!-- A detailed “how-to” in the construction of the project, original design files and code.  -->
						<!-- Photos, images of your project journey, BOM (Bill of materials), what was completed, what was successful, what needs more work, the user manual -->
					
					
					<!-- Presentation: A demonstration of the project, a single page “cover sheet” of the project (saved as _presentation.png,  -->
						<!-- resolution of 1920x1080 describes the project, creator, features), A one-minute video of the project -->

					<p> When test-fitting the ultrasonic sensor, i found that there is enough friction from it being a snug fit. Therefore no extra glue/materials were needed to keep the sensor in place. 
					There is also plenty of clearance for the pin headers (and the wires to be connected later). </p>

					<p align="center"> Using Fusion360, I was able to make a parametric finger-jointed box with a lid, rounded corners and a compartment for the Arduino and relevant eletronics to be stored.
					<br> <br> I referred to this video tutorial (embedded below) to help me create the rounded edges, also known as living hinges.

					<h4 align="center"> Problems Faced: </h4>
					
					<p align="center"> Since the living hinges were very thin, it became very fragile. When bending it for the first time, the living hinge started to crack and break. 
					Thankfully, this does not affect the overall structural intergrity of the hinge, and is not a cause of concern.
					<img src="images/Project/livinghinge_problem.jpg" width="600" height=""> 
					<br> Cracking at the living hinge.
					</p>
					
					<p align="center"> <br> <br> Due to my oversight, there are some pieces that were cut wrongly. These pieces include the bottom piece, as well as the back panel.
					
					
					<img src="images/Project/bottompiece_problem.jpg" width="600" height=""> 
					<br> Excess material causes interference when assembling; needs to be removed.
					
					<img src="images/Project/back panel_problem.jpg" width="600" height=""> 
					<br> Both fingers are in the same position, and causes interference when assembling.
					</p>
					
					
					<h4 align="center"> Solutions to aforementioned problems: </h4>
					
					<p align="center"> To get the bottom piece to fit, I was able to use flush cutters to remove the excess parts (bottom piece). No recutting is neccessary.
					<img src="images/Project/bottompiece_fix.jpg" width="600" height=""> 
					<br> After excess material is removed there is no more interference.

					<p align="center"> <br> <br>
					<img src="images/Project/before&after.jpg" width="300" height=""> 
					<br> Piece had to be recut. Left piece shows before, right shows after.
